# Qidi Tech I Definitions / Profiles / Settings

These are settings files to use the Qidi Tech I with different slicers.

While they've been written specifically for the Qidi Tech I (as that's the printer I have), they'd most likely work with any Replicator clone in the Flashforge Creator Pro family: if you have one of these printers, and are willing to be called upon as maintainer to test further compatibility with any changes made for the Qidi Tech I profiles, please copy this directory to one for your printer, change the names within as applicable, and send a pull request adding your printer to this repository.
